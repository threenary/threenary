#### (also known as Gonzalo)
I am [passionate](https://www.wordnik.com/words/passionate) Software Engineer, and despite you won't find super cool stuff built in docens of languages built even while sleeping in this repo, I can proudly say I have been involved in software development since I have memory, wich has made me [develop good habits and persue software engineering best practices](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532211-i-m-not-a-great-programmer-i-m-just-a-good-programmer). You will find with me a pragmatic and reliable allied when time to build solutions comes.

I enjoy learning from others and sharing my experiences with colleagues to grow together and domain the context we dive into. As I value collboration, I enjoy story telling as a way to share things I learn, read, and time to time I write reflections about challenges I faced, patterns I observe across different projects and teams I interacted with.
